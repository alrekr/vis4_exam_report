\autsection{ECV system}{Hsin-Yu Lee}
Figure~\vref{fig:kootstra2} shows the hierarchical vision system “ECV” implemented in the paper~\cite{kootstra}. The system recognizes objects by 2D and 3D geometrical and appearance relations between visual entities at the different levels of the hierarchy in two major domains, which are edge and surface. The process of recognizing the edge is: First, use the algorithm of image processing to transfer the stereo images into the 2D line segment images. Second, use the mathematic way to find out the smallest line segments. Then, combine the line segments into a larger segment. Finally, the edge of the objects will come out. It’s also similar to the process of forming the surfaces of the object.

The stereo images at the bottom are the real world images captured by the camera, the others pictures show the process in the simulator try to find the object based on the edge and surface information. From~\cite{kootstra}.}
